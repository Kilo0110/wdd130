    <h1>About Me!ðŸ˜Š </h1>
    <p class="text-content">Hello ðŸ‘‹! My name is <b>Divine Ahaka</b> but my friends call me <b>KamCy</b>. I am a
      Nigerian
      residing in
      Lagos state. I am currently on my path to attain a Bachelor's Degree in Computer Science from BYU-Idaho.</p>
    <p class="text-content">I love everything tech, from gadgets to softwares, from cybersecurity to artificial
      intelligence. This is why I learnt to program and I became a web developer. Aside from programming, I am also a
      huge Formula 1 fan, supporting the <b>Mercedes Formula 1</b> team and its driver <b>George Russell</b>. I am not
      married, but I am the last of 5 children and I have a wonderful nephew.</p>
    <p class="text-content">
      I love BYU-Idaho because it provides a unique opportunity for people like me to attain a degree and progress in my
      education alongside living an everyday life. I also love that at BYU-Idaho, an emphasis is also placed on
      spiritual and personal growth to allow students become better leaders and better persons to our family and
      community at large.
    </p>
    <p class="text-content">Even though I have prior experience in the web development space, I am looking forward to
      all the lessons this course will bring because I am certain it is going to broaden my understanding and help me
      become a better programmer.</p>
    <p class="text-content">I am not a member of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints, however I am a
      Christian and my favorite scripture is from the book of Ephesians, in chapter 3 and verse 20 which says
      <q>Now unto him that is able to do exceedingly abundantly above all that we ask or think, according to the
        power
        that worketh in us</q>
    </p>
    <p class="text-content">That's all for now and I am looking forward to a wonderful semester with you all!</p>
